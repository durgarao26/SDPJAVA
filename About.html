            <p>Welcome to the **Citizen-Politician Interaction Platform**, designed to improve communication and transparency between citizens and their elected representatives. Our platform simplifies how citizens can report issues, provide feedback, and stay updated about political actions</p>
            
            <h3>Key Features</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Citizens:</strong> Report issues, provide feedback, and get updates from politicians on decisions that affect your community.</li>
                <li><strong>Politicians:</strong> Respond to citizensâ€™ concerns, post updates on policies, and engage in meaningful dialogue to address public concerns.</li>
                <li><strong>Admin:</strong> Oversee platform operations, ensure data integrity, and manage roles to maintain smooth operations.</li>
